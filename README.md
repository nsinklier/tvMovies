# tvOS Demo App
This is a tvOS project I built to gain hands-on experience with the platform. I found limited documentation on developing tvOS apps, so I created this as a reference for other engineers looking for examples, best practices, and a starting point for their own projects.

If you're exploring tvOS development, I hope this serves as a helpful guide! Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out with questions.

### *Note for iOS engineers: 
You can't interact with the Apple TV simulator the same way you do on an iOS sim. You can tap on the sim to focus, and then use the arrow keys, enter, and esc, but (Command + Shit + R) will show/hide an AppleTV Remote that allows you to control the app. It's not great, but I believe you can actually connect a physical Apple TV remote and use that on the sim, but it requires you to disconnect it from you AppleTV, so I didn't try.
